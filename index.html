        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: We have traveled back in time to a critical time in our history. This is a key moment where our world was nearly destroyed by a mind numbing technology that turned everyone into zombies. This is the zombie apocalypse!</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: It's horrible. What caused our ancestors to suffer this terrible fate?</span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: It's these strange devices they are all carrying around and staring at.  They've all been put into a trance by these things. They can't stop looking at them.</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: What's that strange sound they're all making?</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER:We call it the iMoan.</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: This is too horrible. I can't watch. Why did you bring me back to see all this? </span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: Because history tells us you are the one who stops it. A time traveler with your name is the one who saves humanity?</span> </p>

          <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES:Are you sure it was me?  Jones is a pretty common name.  I went to school with someone with the same name first and last name even, that's how common it is.</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: I sure hope you're the right one. We've been planning this your entire life.</span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: You mean you've been grooming me my whole life to travel back in time and save the world?</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: Yes.</span> </p>


          <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: That explains the guy in the suit and sunglasses that was always following me around as a kid.</span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: I was hoping you didn't notice that.</span> </p>



        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: He was creepy! He gave me nightmares!</span> </p>


          <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: Sorry about that.</span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: I had to get therapy!</span> </p>



        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: We paid for that.</span> </p>



        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: It helped. Thanks.</span> </p>


        <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: You're welcome.</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: So how am I supposed to save the world anyway?</span> </p>


          <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: We're not sure. We just know that you somehow do it alone. No mention of anyone else.</span> </p>


          <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: No mention of you?</span> </p>
          

            
            <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER:Affirmative. Very odd indeed. </span> </p>


            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Hey! Lookout! That zombie is driving a car while looking at one of those devices!</span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: This is  bad. These are all manual vehicles.  No self driving cars in this time period.</span> </p> 



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: It's headed right for us! </span> </p>


            <p><span data-actor="BAKER">BAKER: I have to stop it. You have to be safe!  You must complete your mission!</span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: What are you doing?! </span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Oh no!  Baker's dead. What do I do? Okay, stay calm Jones.  You were trained for this kind of situation.  The emergency kit.  Look in the emergency kit. We have a wound self-cleaning bandage, common cold cure tablet, unlimited credit instant currency card good for any time period, instant shelter just add water, daily meal pill...  a sonic toothbrush... </span> </p> 




        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Did the sonic toothbrush just disrupt your phone?</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">ONES: This sonic toothbrush has higher settings... I'll turn it to up popcorn stuck between the teeth.</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: What's going on?</span> </p>
        <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: I don't know.</span> </p>
        <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: Where am I?</span> </p>

        <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Welcome to the future, my good people.  I have freed you of the terrible creature that took over your world.  Be free of this hideous device forever.</span> </p>



        <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: Hey!  I don't have insurance on that!</span> </p>

          <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: I have the dropsie plan. I can drop it and get a new one. I do that monthly. I always have to have the latest phone.</span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: Let's go get new ones.  I hear the new iPid is awesome.</span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: What's an iPid?</span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: I have no clue but it's new!</span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE"> ZOMBIE: I want one!</span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES:It's no good.  They are obsessed.  I will have to find a way to destroy all the phones. Let's set this to plaque removal. Who would have thought someone could save the world with a sonic toothbrush?</span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Where is that time traveling device anyway?   You'd think an emergency kit would have one or at least a return to home device or something.  Oh well... at least I have this no credit limit currency card...</span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: Zoink!  I'm buying me an iPid.</span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="JONES">JONES: Hey! Give that back! </span> </p>



            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: A daily meal pill?  Hmmm...</span> </p>


            <p><span data-actor="ZOMBIE">ZOMBIE: Hey, it's like I'm eating... like the food is appearing in my mouth as I suck the pill... Fruit Loops... coffee.... Donuts... some kind of melon... pizza for lunch... uh... why would they put anchovies on it?  Uh...</span> </p>
